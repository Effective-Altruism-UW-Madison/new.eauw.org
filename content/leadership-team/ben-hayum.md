Ben is a third-year student from New Jersey. He is double-majoring in Neurobiology and Data Science. He is interested in mental health, meditation, consciousness, intelligence, and futurism. He was planning on working in Brain-Computer Interfaces but now is looking to shift into AI Safety to more effectively combat existential risk. Furthermore, he always leaves the door open for entrepreneurial side ventures to do some extra good, as is reflected by the various projects he manages with us!
