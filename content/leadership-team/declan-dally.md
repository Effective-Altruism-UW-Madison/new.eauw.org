Declan is a senior studying English Linguistics, CS, History, and Japanese. He has been a member of the EA community since Summer 2021 and a leader at EA UW since Spring 2022. He grew up on a farm in rural Wisconsin with vegetarian parents and has actually never eaten meat (so no need to go through the pain of adjusting)\! He cares deeply about both humans and other animals and wants to spend his life improving the happiness, physical health, and mental health of all sentient species. He also has prosopagnosia (more commonly known as "face blindness") so although he loves meeting people, he is usually unable to recognize anyone.
