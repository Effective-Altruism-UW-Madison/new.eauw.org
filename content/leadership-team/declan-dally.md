Declan is a senior studying English Linguistics, CS, History, and Japanese. He has been a member of the EA community since summer 2021 and a leader at EA UW since fall 2021. He is a passionate utilitarian and cares a lot about all beings with utility (perhaps more than is practical). He hopes to work on community building for strong longtermist trajectory change towards a more utilitarian, ethical society (as best he can).
