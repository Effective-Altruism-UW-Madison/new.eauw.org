Casey (formerly Declan) is a senior studying English Linguistics, CS, History, and Japanese. She has been a member of the EA community since Summer 2021 and a leader at EA UW since Spring 2022. She grew up on a farm in rural Wisconsin with vegetarian parents and has actually never eaten meat (so no need to go through the pain of adjusting)! She cares deeply about both humans and other animals and wants to spend her life improving the happiness, physical health, and mental health of all sentient species. She also has prosopagnosia (more commonly known as "face blindness") so although she loves meeting people, she is usually unable to recognize anyone.
