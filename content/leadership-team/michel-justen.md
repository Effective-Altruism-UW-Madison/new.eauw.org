Michel co-founded EA UW in Fall 2020 after hearing a podcast episode, as one does. Together with Lenni, his twin, and the help of early organizers he shaped it to be the group it is today &mdash; which is hopefully still a group of standout people committed to leaving the world better than they entered it. As of this writing, he is finishing up his degrees in Neurobiology and Psychology remotely in Berkeley, where he’s working full time on improving EA infrastructure and skilling up in grant-making and AI alignment. But, if you ask him what he’s doing now, it will almost certainly be something new (rumor has it). He’s happy to <a href="https://calendly.com/mjusten-1/preferred-times" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">chat</a> with all EA UW members!
