Ryan is a sophomore pursuing a degree in Life Sciences Communication, global health, and food systems. Although he is interested in a variety of existential risks among the EA community, his main focus is on ones involving the use of animals, hence his role in [Animal Advocacy UW](https://win.wisc.edu/organization/animal). He is a strong advocate for adopting a [sentiocentric](https://sentience-research.org/definitions/sentiocentrism/) world view, working to abolish animal farming and minimizing wild animal suffering. Ryan has recently begun a chapter of Allied Scholars for Animal Protection ([ASAP](https://www.alliedscholars.org/uwmadison)) at UW-Madison, as well as founding the Alt Protein Project UW-Madison with his buddy Charlie Kotula, in conjunction with the [Good Food Institute](https://gfi.org/the-alt-protein-project/). In his spare time Ryan enjoys building model castles, soccer, and boardgames.
