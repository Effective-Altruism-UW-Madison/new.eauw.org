Eeshaan is a senior studying Computer Sciences and Philosophy. They became interested in EA in late 2020 while thinking about ways to help non-human animals beyond adopting a vegan lifestyle, joined the EA UW leadership team in its early days, and founded Animal Advocacy UW–Madison in Fall 2022. They are particularly interested in suffering-focused ethics and strategies to help make EA more diverse and inclusive of a movement. Their hobbies include casual bike riding, amateur vegan cooking, listening to jazz, drinking kombucha, and language learning (sometimes all at once).
