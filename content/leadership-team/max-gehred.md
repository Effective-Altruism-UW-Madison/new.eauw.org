I'm a Junior and study Philosophy and Statistics. I learned about EA three years ago on Sam Harris's podcast, and was pretty instantly impacted by it. The fact that there’s a whole community dedicated to applying the tools of science to figure out how we can best improve the lives of others (and then who actually take action on these findings) continues to refresh and amaze me. I’ve been especially impacted by Singer’s work and am probably most interested in ethics, but I really just love talking about philosophy in general.Beyond EA, I love board games, smash ultimate, and lifting. I also play a lot of pickup sports, especially ultimate and basketball (also built a beer die table this summer which i’ve been playing a lot). Like many of us here, I’m trying to start a habit of mindfulness and am also a practicing stoic. As I mentioned above I love meeting people so feel free to reach out if anyone wants to chat or hangout.
