Hey, my name is Max : ) I'm a senior studying Statistics and Philosophy, and I've been involved in this group since it began. I want to pursue a career in politics because I thinks it's my best opportunity to improve the lives of others. I'm especially interested in ethics, economic policy, politically palatable animal welfare reform, and addressing oft-neglected tail risks. I also like basketball, ultimate frisbee, smash ultimate, and lots of music.

If you want to do good with your career, I think we can help you! You should [meet with me](https://calendly.com/maxgehred/30min?month=2023-08) if you want to learn more - cheers!
