Max is a junior studying Philosophy and Statistics and has been passionate about EA since early 2020. He's especially interested in the philosophical justifications for EA and ethics more broadly. Apart from EA, he loves recreational sports, weight lifting, podcasts, running, board games, and _Smash Ultimate_. He's excited bringing the ideas of effective altruism to UWâ€“Madison and building a campus community of altruists dedicated to doing as much good possible.
