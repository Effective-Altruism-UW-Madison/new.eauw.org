# Welcome back!

## EA UWâ€“Madisonâ€™s future.

We are excited to be returning to UWâ€“Madison for our organizationâ€™s second year. Since last year, our leadership team has grown and weâ€™ve furthered our commitment to promoting Effective Altruism on campus.

Before you do anything else, please take a moment to join our Slack â€“ our main communication platform â€“ and introduce yourself in the #introductions channel if you havenâ€™t already.

This semester we will be hosting our signature 8-week Introduction to Effective Altruism Fellowship. The Effective Altruism Fellowship helps students figure out how we can do the most good with our lives (and particularly our careers) by introducing the ideas and applications of Effective Altruism: the science of combining evidence and compassion to find the best opportunities for improving the world. We will also discuss criticisms and questions of Effective Altruism. In the last week of the fellowship, we will host a career workshop for us to think through how we can increase our positive impact through our careers.

Topics covered in the fellowship include:

- Measuring impact â€” how to do the most good with our limited resources
- Global health and poverty â€” with a focus on neglected tropical disease eradication in developing regions
- Factory farming â€” how should we evaluate and address animal suffering
- Emerging technologies â€” how transformative artificial intelligence and advances in biotechnology might affect the world
- Longtermism â€” how should we take into account the well-being of future generations
- Global catastrophic risks â€” with a focus on AI safety, pandemic risks, climate change, and nuclear risks

## New to Effective Altruism?

The world faces so many challenging problems that it can be difficult to know where to start. For people who want to change the world for the better, effective altruism offers a framework for comparing different ways to do good and then acting on the most promising of them. Effective altruism is both a research field and a community of people dedicated to using high-quality evidence and careful reasoning to work out how to help others as much as possible.

There are many reasons you might be interested in learning more about effective altruism. If you are interested in preventing pandemics and nuclear wars, stopping the factory farming of animals, giving to effective charities, understanding the risks of artificial intelligence, ethics, evidence-based discussions, and doing good, then this organization is for you!
