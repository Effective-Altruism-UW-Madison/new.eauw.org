Assuring that the trajectory for the long-term future is heading in a safe, positive direction is potentially one of the most impactful things we could be doing right now. Recognizing this need, we host a free Fellowship programs to equip students with the knowledge to take seriously these threats to the future and the tools to think critically about their career ambitions. By the end of the fellowship, participants have access to in-depth coaching, career advice/connections, and unique opportunities to work on these issues. We look forward to learning with you.
