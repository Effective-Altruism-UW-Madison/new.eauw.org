Some efforts to improve the world can be much more impactful than others. Smallpox eradication, the abolitionist movement, germ theory, and the Green Revolution demonstrate what's possible when people come together to solve pressing problems. At the other end of the spectrum, many well-intended initiatives are ineffective or even counterproductive. Doing good better is one of the defining challenges of our time.

Recognizing this need, EA UW hosts free Fellowship programs to equip students with the knowledge to do good in the world more effectively and the tools to think critically about their career ambitions. By the end of the fellowship, participants have access to in-depth coaching, career advice/connections, and unique opportunities to help others.
