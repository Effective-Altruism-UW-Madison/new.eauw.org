As UW–Madison students we have an awesome opportunity to use our careers to improve the lives of others. The average career lasts 80,000 hours, that’s a long time. If you could increase the impact of your career by just 1%, it would make sense to spend 800 hours thinking about how to do that. And we think this program can increase your impact by much more, and in much less time.

Join us for our Conference and Careers Program where you'll develop long-term career plan and actionable next steps to pursue a high-impact career and have the chance to network and resolves career uncertainties with industry professionals at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.eaglobal.org/events/eagxberkeley2022/">EAGx Berkeley</a>.
