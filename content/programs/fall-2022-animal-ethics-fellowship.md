Issues related to the suffering of non-human animals is often absent in discourse related to the most pressing issues currently facing the world. Recognizing the need for education and awareness around these issues, Animal Advocacy UWâ€“Madison is hosting a free fellowship program to equip students with the knowledge to understand the most pressing issues involving animals and the tools to think critically about their career ambitions in this field. By the end of the fellowship, participants have access to in-depth coaching, career advice/connections, and unique opportunities to work on these issues. We look forward to learning with you.
