## New to Effective Altruism?

The world faces so many challenging problems that it can be difficult to know where to start. For people who want to change the world for the better, effective altruism offers a framework for comparing different ways to do good and then acting on the most promising of them. Effective altruism is both a research field and a community of people dedicated to using high-quality evidence and careful reasoning to work out how to help others as much as possible.

There are many reasons you might be interested in learning more about effective altruism. If you are interested in preventing pandemics and nuclear wars, stopping the factory farming of animals, giving to effective charities, understanding the risks of artificial intelligence, ethics, evidence-based discussions, and doing good, then this organization is for you!
